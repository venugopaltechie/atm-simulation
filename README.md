# atm-simulation
This project is a Python-based ATM Simulation System that replicates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to create an account, authenticate using an account number and PIN, and perform standard banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and fund transfers.
